        <b>Switch case : </b> The JavaScript switch statement evaluates an expression and executes a block of code based on matching cases. It provides an alternative to long if-else chains, improving readability and maintainability, especially when handling multiple conditional branches.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Loop : </b> JavaScript loops are essential for efficiently handling repetitive tasks. They execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. These loops are powerful tools for automating tasks and streamlining your code.
