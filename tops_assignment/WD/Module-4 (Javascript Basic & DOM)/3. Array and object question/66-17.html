<!-- What is the disadvantage of using innerHTML in javascript? -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>66-17</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time.

</body>
</html>
