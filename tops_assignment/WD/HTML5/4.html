    <!-- 4. Canvas and SVG tags -->
    <p>
        SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based format used for defining two-dimensional vector graphics on the web. Unlike raster images such as .jpg, .gif, or .png, SVG images can be scaled to any size without losing quality
    </p>

    <p>
        The HTML5 Canvas element provides a space on the web page where you can dynamically draw graphics using JavaScript. Unlike SVG, which is vector-based, Canvas is pixel-based (raster).
