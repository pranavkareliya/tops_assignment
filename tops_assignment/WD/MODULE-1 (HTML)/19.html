    <!-- What is difference between HTML and XHTML? -->
    <p>
        HTML (HypertextMarkup Language) and XHTML (ExtensibleHypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating and displaying web pages. The main difference between them is the syntax and structure; HTML is more lenient in its syntax, while XHTML has a more strict syntax and follows XML rules.
