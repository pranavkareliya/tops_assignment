    <!-- What are logical and physical tags in HTML? -->
    <p>
        <b>Logical tags</b> are used to tell the browser what kind of text is written inside the tags. They are different from physical tags because physical tags are used to decide the appearance of the text and do not provide any information about the text.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Physical tags</b> include Bold, Italic, Underline, Subscript, Superscript etc. To make a content bold <b> tag is used. <i> is used to make content italic. The content between <u> and </u> are underlined.
