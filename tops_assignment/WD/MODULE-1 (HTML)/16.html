    <!-- How are active links different from normal links? -->
    <p>
        A normal link is just a line of code that contains a pointer to another resource. An active link is that line of code in action, opening that other resource.
    </p>

    <!-- Example -->

    <!-- If you click left or right button of the links Visited or Unvisited, it will turn into Red and Underline. -->
