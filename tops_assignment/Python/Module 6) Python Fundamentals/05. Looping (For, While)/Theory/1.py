# Introduction to for and while loops.

# for loop
print("For loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. In Python, there is “for in” loop which is similar to foreach loop in other languages. Let us learn how to use for loops in Python for sequential traversals with examples.")

# while loop
print("While loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.")
