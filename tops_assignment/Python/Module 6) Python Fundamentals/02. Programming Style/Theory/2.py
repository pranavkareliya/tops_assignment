# Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.

# Indentation
print("Whitespace is used for indentation in Python. Unlike many other programming languages which only serve to make the code easier to read, Python indentation is mandatory. One can understand it better by looking at an example of indentation in Python.")

# comments
print("Python comments start with the hash symbol # and continue to the end of the line. Comments in Python are usually helpful to someone maintaining or enhancing your code when you are no longer around to answer questions about it.")

# naming conventions
print("Naming conventions in Python refer to rules and guidelines for naming variables, functions, classes, and other entities in your code. Adhering to these conventions ensures consistency, readability, and better collaboration among developers.")
