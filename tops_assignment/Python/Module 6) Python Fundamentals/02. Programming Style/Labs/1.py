# Write a Python program that demonstrates the correct use of indentation, comments, and variables following PEP 8 guidelines.

# Indentation:
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6] # a is variables
for i in a :
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print("Odd Number : ",i) # odd Number print # comments
    else :
        print("Even Number :",i) # Even Number print # comments
