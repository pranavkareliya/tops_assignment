# Basic operations: concatenation, repetition, string methods (upper(), lower(), etc.).

print("In Python, there are certain methods implemented to use on strings. These are often available with the string method and often they return a new string or boolean rather than modifying the original string. This is because strings are immutable.")

print("Concatenates :- Concatenates two strings")
print("Repetition :- Make copies of string")
print("Upper :- Convert all the characters in a string to uppercase.")
print("Lower :- Convert all the characters in a string to lowercase.")
