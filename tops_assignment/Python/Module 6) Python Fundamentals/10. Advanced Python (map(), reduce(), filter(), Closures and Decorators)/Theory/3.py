# Introduction to closures and decorators.

# closures
print("A closure in Python occurs when a nested function captures the local variables from its enclosing scope. This allows the nested function to access these variables even after the outer function has finished executing.")

# decorators
print("Python Decorators are a powerful and expressive tool in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or method. They are often used to add wrapping functionality to existing functions in a clean and readable way.")
