# Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing)

print("In Python, lists are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element is at index 0, the second element at index 1, and so on. Negative indexes, on the other hand, start from -1, where -1 represents the last element in the list, -2 represents the second-to-last element.")
