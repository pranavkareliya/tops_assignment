The urls.py file is where URL patterns are defined. It's typically located in your app directory.
Django uses these patterns to match incoming requests and direct them to the appropriate view functions.
       
View Functions (views.py):
View functions contain the logic to handle requests and return responses.
They receive an HttpRequest object as their first argument and can return an HttpResponse object or render a template.
