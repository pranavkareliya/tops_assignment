# Write a Django project where URL routing is used to navigate between different pages of a “Doctor Finder” site (home, profile, contact).

print("""

In Django, URL routing facilitates navigation between different pages by mapping specific URL patterns to their corresponding view functions. This process is defined in the urls.py file within your app or project directory.
      
Defining URL Patterns:
URL patterns are defined using the path() or re_path() functions. The path() function is generally preferred for simpler cases and uses a more readable syntax, while re_path() allows for more complex patterns using regular expressions.
